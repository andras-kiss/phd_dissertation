The present work has been devoted to improving the potentiometric Scanning Electrochemical Microscope.
Scanning is relatively slow due to the long response time of the potentiometric measuring cell.
Shortened scanning time is useful when the studied system is changing.
I've successfully sped up the technique without compromising image quality.

The main results are summarized by some concluding remarks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item I've successfully shortened response time of the potentiometric cell by using low resistance, solid-contact microelectrodes.
I've compared them to conventional, liquid contact microelectrodes by basic characterization and model system study to prove the improved performance.

\item Taking adventage of the new solid-contact electrodes, I've studied the galvanic corrosion of magnesium and the AZ63 magnesium alloy.
I've estimated the corrosion current based on the measurements, and compared the result with that obtained with another, established method.
The two were very similar.

\item I've designed new scanning patterns and algorithms, optimized to radially symmetric targets.
I've proven that with these new patterns and algorithms, image distortion is lower compared to the conventional ones, by numerical simulations and experimental SECM scans.

\item I've succesfully applied the new scanning patterns and algorithms to study the galvanic corrosion of radially symmetric magnesium samples.

\item I've shown that by using deconvolution, \emph{RC} distortion can be significantly lowered in the potentiometric SECM images.
To prove the validity of the technique, I've compared deconvoluted images to equilibrium images scanned at a rate which allowed to record equilibrium potentials.

\item I've used deconvolution to restore potentiometric SECM images about corroding carbon steel, copper, and zinc samples.
Evaluation of these data is much easier, because scanning time could be reduced without increasing image distortion.
