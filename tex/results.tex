\chapter{Results and Discussion}
I've tried three approaches to alleviate the compromise between low distortion and short scanning time in the potentiometric SECM.
The problem stems from the high \emph{RC} time-constant.
For a sufficiently small microelectrode, the resistance \emph{R} can be so high, that the time-constant is measured in seconds.
To arrive at the equilibrium potential of the measuring electrode, about 4$\times$\emph{RC} time must be allowed for the cell.
Such high equilibration period is not practical, since a high number of sampling points must be included in the image raster to achieve the desired high resolution, and the 4$\times$\emph{RC} equilibration period must be waited at every sampling point.
This means, for an image to be recorded with a step size of \emph{s} ($\upmu$m), image side length of \emph{L} ($\upmu$m), probe translation speed of \emph{v} ($\upmu$m/s), and an equilibration period of $t_e$ ($s$), it takes $t$ ($s$) time to complete the image, calculated with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scantime}
	t = (L/s+1)^{2}\times(s/v + t_e)
\end{equation}

Using the example from the \emph{"Introduction"}, if \emph{R} = 1 G$\ohm$ and \emph{C} = 500 pF, then \emph{RC} = 0.5 s, and $t$=882 s, or about 16 min, since about $t_e = 4 \times RC$ is necessary to obtain the equilibrium electrode potential with good approximation.
To decrease the overall scanning time, there are a number of possibilities.
If \emph{L} or $t_e$ is decreased or \emph{v} or \emph{s} is increased, then $t$ is decreased.
But, if the scanned area or resolution cannot be decreased further, then manipulating \emph{L} and \emph{s} is not a viable option.
The parameters left are $t_e$ and $v$.
To decrease $t_e$ and maintain image quality, $RC$ must be decreased simultaneously.
This is the first approach I took, and is detailed in Section \ref{solid_result}.

In the second and third approaches I exploit the properties of the potentiometric response function:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rc}
        E_{cell}(t_{e}) = E_{cell}(\infty) + [E_{cell}(0) - E_{cell}(\infty)]e^{-t_{e}/RC}
\end{equation}
where $E_{cell}(t)$ is the cell potential difference at time $t_{e}$, $E_{cell}(\infty)$ is the equilibrium cell potential difference, $E_{cell}(0)$ is the cell potential difference prior to the change.
The more different $E_{cell}(0)$ and $E_{cell}(\infty)$ are, the more the difference between $E_{cell}(\infty)$ and $E_{cell}(t_{e})$ will be.
Distortion of an image can be measured as an average of the differences between $E_{cell}(\infty)$ and $E_{cell}(t_{e})$ at each point.
It can be lowered by carefully optimizing scanning patterns and algorithms, so that the probe passes through borders between regions of high and low concentrations as few times as possible.
This approach is detailed in Section \ref{patterns_result}.

In the third approach, I use the inverse of the potentiometric response function (Eq. \ref{eq:rc}) as deconvolution function.
Since the relationship between $t_e$, $E_{cell}(0)$, $E_{cell}(t_e)$ and $E_{cell}(\infty)$ is known, a prediction for the only unknown $E_{cell}(\infty)$ can be calculated.
This approach is detailed in Section \ref{dec_result}.

Additionally, to increase the probe translation speed $v$ and maximize the time available for cell potential equilibration ($t_e$), a custom SECM was built at our department, and used in the second and third approach.
Increasing $v$ has practical limitations, for a probe moving too fast between sampling points might stir the electrolyte.
Scanning speeds of commercially available SECM devices however, haven't reached this limit, and are in the range of several tens of micrometers per second at best, due to hardware or software restrictions.
With the custom built microscope, translation speeds up to 1000 $\upmu$m/s are possible.

	\section{Using solid-contact electrodes as potentiometric SECM probes}
	\label{solid_result}
Solid-contact electrodes have lower resistance, compared to their otherwise identical, liquid-contact counterparts.
This is due to two reasons.
The solid contact can be pushed down very close to the micropipette orifice, shortening the thickness of the highly resistive ion-selective membrane, and decreasing the overall electrode resistance.
The other reason is that instead of the internal solution -- which has high resistance --, a modified carbon fiber -- which has low resistance -- is used as the ion-to-electron transducer.
If $R$ is lower, $RC$ is lower, and the potentiometric cell becomes faster.


		\subsection{Electrode characterization and images of a model system}
I constructed two Mg$^{2+}$-ion selective electrodes.
One used a liquid contact, and the other a solid contact.
Besides this difference, they were prepared identically.
Basic characterisation was performed for both.
Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_calibration}A and \ref{fig:solid_liquid_calibration}B shows the calibration plots for the liquid, and solid contact electrode, respectively.
Sensitivities towards the primary ion (Mg$^{2+}$) were close to nernstian and very similar, 29.12 mV and 33.44 mV for the liquid and solid contact electrode, respectively.
The solid contact electrode had a slightly wider dynamic range, reaching below $10^{-5}$ M.
Selectivity coefficients, characterization of the potassium ion-selective electrode, and further characterization of the magnesium ion-selective electrode can be found in \cite{calugareanu2013ion}.

\label{fig:solid_liquid_calibration}
\end{figure}

Response characteristics were investigated by measuring the electrode resistance $R$, and the $\tau_{95}$ response time.
The two parameters are related: $1-e^{-3RC/RC} = 1-e^{-3} \approx 0.95$.
This means, that $3\times RC \approx \tau_{95}$, because in $3\times RC$, equilibrium electrode potential is reached by about 95\%.
Calculated from the voltage divider measurements (Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_response_time}, Table \ref{table:comp}), electrode resistance was 4.8 $G\ohm$ and 0.56 $G\ohm$ for the liquid, and solid contact electrodes, respectively.
The measured $\tau_{95}$ parameters were 71.1 s, and 27.7 s, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_resistance}).
Based on these values, the solid contact electrode was expected to produce less distorted images with the same scanning parameters.

\label{fig:solid_liquid_resistance}
\end{figure}

To confirm it, a Mg$^{2+}$ ion diffusion source model system was created, and the plane 100 $\upmu$m above the pipette orifice was scanned with both electrodes.
Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_pipette} shows the ISME images obtained using a liquid-contact (A), and a solid-contact (B), micropipette electrode.
Both 2D ISME maps were recorded at a scan rate of 12.5 $\upmu$m/s.
The same pipette holding the 0.1 M MgCl$_2$ agar solution was used in the measurements plotted in Figs. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_pipette}A and \ref{fig:solid_liquid_pipette}B.
Visual inspection of the two images clearly shows significant image distortion in the X-direction with the liquid-contact ISME due its slower response as expected based on its higher resistance.
It can also be observed in the image scanned with the solid-contact electrode, although to a much less extent.
The overlayed isoconcentric countour lines are more circular, and not as elongated in the X-direction as in the case of the image prepared with the convential electrode.
Another important feature to note in the images is the difference in the highest magnesium ion concentration observed with the two electrodes.
With the solid-contact microelectrode it's about $10^{-2.5}$ M.
On the other hand, with the conventional liquid-contact electrode, highest observed magnesium ion concentration is only about $10^{-3.4}$ M.
One possible reason for this is that the cell equipped with the liquid-contact electrode cannot keep up with the changes of the magnesium ion concentration at the micropipette orifice.
That is, it passes over the area with the highest concentration so quickly, that by the time the cell would reach the potential corresponding to that concentration, the probe is already at another location, with a lower concentration.
Potential starts dropping, while it approaches the new equilibrium potential.

		\subsection{Applications}
			\subsubsection{Investigation of galvanic and homogeneous corrosion of magnesium}
In paper (II), we used the Mg$^{2+}$ ion-selective electrodes to image Mg$^{2+}$ ion concentration above the corroding samples and compared the results.
Based on the pipette source model target experiment and the resistivity measurements, it was expected that the cell equipped with the solid-contact electrode would yield less distorted images.
Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_corrosion} shows the four scans.
Inspecting the images about the uncoupled magnesium (Fig. \ref{fig:solid_liquid_corrosion}A1-A2), it is clear that the image scanned with the liquid-contact electrode is more distorted.
The individual scanlines are blurred in the $X$ direction, just like in the previous experiment with the pipette source.
The same can be said about the images of the galvanically coupled magnesium.
The one scanned with the solid-contact electrode is less distorted.
Also, higher peak values can be observed, corresponding to magnesium dissolution.
These anodic spots are resolved much better by the solid-contact electrode.

Scans were performed with the Sensolytics SECM, with impedance matching provided by the TL082 based voltage follower.
Reference electrode was Ag/AgCl/3M KCl.
Height of scan was 100 $\upmu$m, scanrate was 12.5 $\upmu$m/s.}
\label{fig:solid_liquid_corrosion}
\end{figure}

			\subsubsection{Estimation of corrosion current based on vertical SECM scans}
Mg$^{2+}$ ion concentration profiles above the Mg sample were recorded by SECM scans.
Vertical Mg$^{2+}$ ion concentration distribution was determined at different instants in time of the corrosion process, with, and without coupling the Mg/Al and Fe samples.
About ten times more Mg$^{2+}$ is being formed with coupling.
Mg$^{2+}$ concentration was increasing with time above the sample while coupled, on the other hand, it was decreasing after 10 minutes while not coupled (Fig. \ref{fig:retracting}A).
Based on the method of Scott and White \cite{scott1993iontophoretic}, using the Mg$^{2+}$ concentration profiles, Mg$^{2+}$ flow rate from the Mg piece was possible to estimate:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:corrosion_current}
        \Omega = 4 D C_s a
\end{equation}

where $\Omega$ is the amount of Mg$^{2+}$ released from the disc shaped Mg/Al surface, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of Mg$^{2+}$, $C_s$ is the surface concentration of Mg$^{2+}$ (at the height z = 0 $\upmu$m), a is the radius of the Mg/Al sample.
As the only unknown variable in the equation above, $\Omega$ could be calculated.
Substituting the value of D = 7.06$\times$10$^{-8}$ $dm^2s^{-1}$ \cite{lide2001crc}, $C_s=3.29\times10^{-2}$ M, a = 0.0038 dm, the result is $\Omega$ = $3.53\times10^{-11}$ mol/s.

\label{fig:retracting}
\end{figure}

Corrosion current between the Mg/Al sample and four Fe samples with different diameters was also measured directly.
As expected, current gets higher with increasing diameter.
Corrosion current was 8.87 $\upmu$A, 15.83 $\upmu$A, 16.72 $\upmu$A, 24.4 $\upmu$A with Fe sample diameters of 0.59 mm, 0.76 mm, 1.2 mm, 2.3 mm, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:corrosion_current_measurements}).
Using Faraday's law of electrolysis, this means, that $8.20\times10^{-11}$ mol Mg$^{2+}$ is being dissolved in every second from the Mg/Al sample ($\Omega_{0.76mm} = 8.20\times10^{-11} mol/s$).
This result is in fairly good agreement with the SECM measurement ($\Omega = 3.53\times10^{-11}$ mol/s).
Ion flow rates from Mg/Al samples coupled with Fe samples of different diameters are proportional with the surface area of the sample; $\Omega_{0.59mm} = 4.60\times10^{-11} mol/s, \Omega_{1.2mm} = 4.66\times10^{-11} mol/s, \Omega_{2.3mm} = 1.26\times10^{-10} mol/s$.

	\section{Optimization of scanning algorithms}
	\label{patterns_result}
		\subsection{SECM simulations}
First, SECM scanning simulations were performed and the resulting images were compared (Figure \ref{fig:simulations}).
It was expected that the new, polar coordinate-based scanning algorithms would yield less distorted images than the traditional, raster-based algorithms.
Not only the two new algorithms finish faster, but result images with lower distortion (Table \ref{table:comp}).
Mean squared error is $9.63\times 10^{-3}$ and $2.95\times 10^{-3}$ for the images scanned with the web and the arc algorithms, respectively.
In comparison, mean squared error for the images scanned with traditional meander, fast-comb, and comb algorithms are $2.75\times 10^{-2}$, $2.07\times 10^{-2}$, and $2.75\times 10^{-2}$, respectively.

		\subsection{Experimental SECM images}
Next, the experimental SECM scans were performed, with the same scanning algorithms as the simulations were.
The results (Figure \ref{fig:measurements}) confirmed our presumption, that using the two new algorithms, images have less distortion, with higher similarity to the expected image.

Considering scanning time also, which are 440, 520, and 881 seconds for the meander, fast-comb, and comb algorithms, and 109, and 340 seconds for the web, and arc patterns respectively, it can be said, that the new scanning algorithms proposed in this paper shorten scanning time, and significantly improve imaging quality of circularly symmetric systems.
There are two additional advantageous properties of the new algorithms.
First, data is gathered in order of decreasing relevance, from closest to the target, to farthest from the target, without the corners of the rectangular raster patterns, which are of less importance, because of the larger distance from the target.
Second, with the new algorithms, there is only positive imaging distortion (Figure \ref{fig:patterns}I, J).
The observed potential, for a perfect hemispherical concentration distribution, in theory, cannot be lower above the center than the maximum value.
It also cannot be higher, since the probe starts scanning in the center, where $E_{cell}(t) \approx E_{cell}(\infty)$ (Equation \ref{eq:rc}).
But positive distorion can occur as the probe leaves the close vicinity of the target, advancing towards coordinates with lower concentration.
This has an importance when accurate quantitative information is required about the concentration distribution above the target, such as in estimating fluxes by fitting simulation to measured images \cite{gyurcsanyi2004chemical, kiss2011air}.

	\section{Signal processing in potentiometric SECM}
	\label{dec_result}

		\subsection{Deconvolution of measurements performed with metal/metal-oxide microelectrodes}
In this section, deconvolution of measurements obtained with the metal/metal-oxide electrodes (antimony/antimony-oxide, and tungsten/tungsten-oxide) are attempted.
First, a simple step response, then 1D linescans, and finally 2D raster images were deconvoluted.
It has been pointed out to the author on the Analytica Conference 2016 just a few days before the submission of the thesis, that a method has been already proposed in 1981 to deteremine the response time of potentiometric cells, based on the initial portion of the response curve, since it holds the same information.
However, they didn't go any further with their proposition.
As Lindner and his coauthors write in \cite{lindner1984definition}:

\begin{quote}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\emph{,,This new definition [of response time] has several advantages in contrast to the earlier propositions and accepted definitions: it does not require the knowledge of the equilibrium potential value ($E_{\infty}$); it holds the same sort of information as the time constant of a theoretical equation; it can be used in the case of response time curves consisting of different sections, e.g., even for rapid kinetic studies when $t \approx 0$ (6), and in practice it helps the analysts in determining when potential readings are to be taken.
Accordingly to eliminate subjective errors in readings, one can regard the potential value corresponding to a limiting slope (dE/dt) as the steady-state or equilibrium value.
This idea is realized in some pH meters produced by Radelkis (Hungary) in which a so-called slope controller is built in (16).
\footnote{(6) refers to \cite{lindner1982response} and (16) refers to \cite{havas1981}}''}

\end{quote}


			\subsubsection{Minimal working example: deconvolution of a step response}
The ,,minimal working example'' method, originally used in programming, is a way of tracking down problems, and finding the cause of certain behaviour.
The important feature of a minimal working example is that it is as simple as possible, such that it is just sufficient to demonstrate the problem, but without any additional complexity which would make resolution harder.
In this case, the minimal working example is a simple step function: the activity of the primary ion is changed suddenly, while the response of the potentiometric cell is recorded.
The input of the system is a step function, the output is the recorded signal, an exponential decay function.
If there is no additional distortion, and the transfer function is simply Eq. \ref{eq:rc2}, the square step should be restored. 

To measure the time-constant, the transient response curve of the potentiometric cell was recorded while the pH = 4 buffer solution was changed to pH = 6.
Then, Eq. \ref{eq:rc} was fitted on the curve (Fig. \ref{fig:transient}).
Based on the fit, time constant of the cell is $\tau = 3.76 s$, and $e^{-0.5s/3.76s} = 0.8755$, which means, only 12\% of the total change occurs in 0.5 s ($1 - 0.8755 = 0.1245$).

This $RC$ implies a very high resistance.
It is possible to estimate the resistance of the antimony microelectrode from the specific resistance and the geometry of the antimony wire.
Diameter, as mentioned in the chapter \emph{,,Materials and Methods''}, was 30 $\upmu$m, length of the antimony wire was around 5 cm.
Specific resistance of antimony is 417 n$\ohm m$ (at 20 $\celsius$) \cite{lide2001crc}.
Then, resistance could be calculated as $R = 417 n\ohm m \times 0.05 m / ((15 \upmu m)^2 \times \pi) = 29.50 \ohm$.
It must be noted however, that the measured resistance is a property of the whole cell, not just the microelectrode.
Resistance of the reference electrode, and that of the solution are included.
Nevertheless, the difference between the estimated and the measured values is still too high.
The very significant deviation from the expected value just calculated can be explained by a discontinuity defect in the antimony electrode, although it is unlikely, since all of the antimony electrodes appeared to have such a high resistance.
Another way it could be explained is that there is a strongly adhered laminar layer (Prandtl-layer) on the surace of the electrode, and the exchange of this layer in a new solution is the slowest process.
This has been discussed thoroughly by Lindner et al. in \cite{lindner1976response}.
Unfortunately, it has been pointed out to the author only a few days before submitting the thesis, by Professors Mirkin and Bakker on the Analytica Conference 2016, and new experiments couldn't yet be performed to further investigate the discrepancy.
It could be verified by measuring the resistance of the antimony microelectrode by the voltage divider method, since the Prandtl-layer won't go through any change throughout the measurement, and the real $R$ could be obtained after substracting the resistance of the reference electrode, and the resistance of the solution between the reference and measuring electrodes.
The voltage divider method was used in the case of the experiments with the magnesium, and potassium ion-selective micropipettes discussed later in the thesis, therefore this is not a problem there.
Another way to resolve the problem would be to carry out activity-step measurements while the measured sample buffers are stirred with different RPMs.
With increasing RPM, the measured $RC$ should converge closer and closer to the actual $RC$, since the transformation of the adhered layer would be faster and faster.

\caption[]{Transient response of the antimony microelectrode to analyte activity step (red), and decovolutions performed with different assumed $RC$ time-constants.

The measuring and reference electrodes were dipped into buffer solutions with pH = 4 and pH = 6 respectively.}
\label{fig:deconvoluted_transient}
\end{figure}

The deconvolution of the very same recording was performed with several different time-constants, including that obtained from the response curve.
Fig. \ref{fig:deconvoluted_transient} shows the results of those deconvolutions.
As expected, the recording becomes most similar to the step function when the measured $RC$ time-constant is used.
When a higher value was substituted into Eq. \ref{eq:rc2}, the recorded potential was underestimated, and the deconvolution recovered more than necessary.
If a lower value was used, the cell was assumed to be faster than it actually was, and the deconvoluted potential values did not reach the equilibrium values.
To confirm the visual observation, statistics was performed on the deconvoluted data.
Mean squared error was calculated by first taking the difference between the input function and the deconvoluted function at every time instance.
Then the square of those differences was averaged.
The input function was defined as 

\begin{equation}
E_{cell}(t) =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		-183.18 mV & \mbox{if } t < 50 s \\
		-280.20 mV & \mbox{if } t \geq 50 s
	\end{array}
\right.
\label{eq:piecewise}
\end{equation}

The values for initial ($E_{cell}(0) = -183.18 mV$) and equilibrium ($E_{cell}(\infty) = -280.20 mV$) potentials were obtained by averaging certain portions of the recorded signal: the average from 0 to 49 s is -183.18 mV, and the average from 60 to 80 s is -280.20 mV.
\ref{eq:piecewise} should be obtained experimentally if the potentiometric cell was infinitely fast, and $RC$ would be 0.

                \end{tabular}
\end{table}


Table \ref{table:rc} shows the results of the statistical evaluation.
The performed statistics confirms the assumption and the visual observation.
Lowest mean squared error was obtained when the measured $RC$ time-constant ($\tau = 3.76 s$) was used for the deconvolution.

There are some additional remarks that should be noted observing Fig. \ref{fig:transient}.
The fitted curve is slightly different than the recorded response.
This means, that the transfer function is more complicated than Eq. \ref{eq:rc2}.
At the beginning of the change (from 0 s to about 5 s in Fig. \ref{fig:transient}B), the recorded signal was approaching the equilibrium cell potential slightly faster, then it slowed down.
The effect of this can be observed in the first few data points of the deconvoluted measurement: there is a minor overshoot compared to the equilibrium potential, even in the one that was deconvoluted with the measured $RC$.

The slight deviation from the ideal behaviour was not investigated in this thesis, and might be completely the effect of the error in measuring $RC$.
It was observed in all of the measurements, and the error was certainly carried through to all of the deconvoluted images, when the original measurement was performed with the antimony microelectrode. 

Despite this discrepancy, with deconvolution, a sharp step function could be obtained from the potential-time measurement, which was very similar to the step function caused by the sudden change in activity of the hydrogen ions.
This means, that whatever the cause of the difference between the calculated and estimated resistance is, it distorts the measurement in a very similar way to the $RC$ distortion.

			\subsubsection{Linescans performed with the antimony microelectrode}

Going further, deconvolution of the simplest SECM experiment, the deconvolution of linescans was attemped.
The potentiometric cell included the same measuring and reference electrodes.
A model system was built to perform the linescan on.
In the system, a hemispherical pH gradient was created.
The measured time constant ($\tau = 3.76 s$), implies a significant amount of imaging distortion if the equilibration period is only $t_e = 0.5 s$.
As mentioned in the previous section, during $0.5 s$, only about 12\% of the total change occurs, and the measured difference between the recorded signal at two consecutive data aquisition points is significantly less than the difference between the equilibrium potentials.
Since a single linescan can be completed very quickly, for reference a linescan was performed with $t_e = 5 s$.
With this equilibration interval, the recorded potential at each point can be regarded equilibrium potential, and the linescan can be used as reference for the deconvoluted linescans performed with shorter $t_e$.
Fig. \ref{fig:lines_pH}A shows the raw linescans 100 $\upmu$m above the graphite anode.
Indeed, with $t_e = 0.5 s$, a significant amount of distortion can be observed.
When $t_e$ was increased to $1 s$, the distortion decreased.
After deconvolution however, all of the linescans became similar to the equilibrium linescans, regarding both their peak value, and shape (Fig. \ref{fig:lines_pH}B).

\label{fig:deconvolution}
\end{figure}
Next, four 2D SECM scans were performed identically (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvolution}A-D), with the meander scanning algorithm.
The potentiometric cell and the studied system was the same as in the previous section.
Again, line blur distortion in the raw images is visible along the alternating scanlines used by the meander scanning algorithm.
By deconvoluting the images, the expected potential maps can be obtained (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvolution}E-H). 

Not only the circular shape of the target in the images is restored, but the peak value above the center of the target as well.
Maximum value in the raw scans was around -300 mV, whereas in the deconvoluted image, it was about -260 mV, with a significant difference between the two. 

			\subsubsection{2D scans performed with the tungsten microelectrodes}
Additionally, 2D SECM scans were also performed with two different tungsten microelectrodes: one prepared from commercial tungsten microwire, and another from the filament of a 100 W Tungsram incandescent lighbulb.
$RC$ were determined with the same method, and were $4.62 s$ and $4.40s$, respectively.
The studied target in this case was the zinc-copper galvanic pair.
The scans were performed 100 $\upmu$m above the copper target, while it was galvanically coupled to the zinc wire.
Line blur distortion is also visible here in the raw images.
After deconvolution the expected potential maps can be obtained (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvolution_tungsten}C-D).
Electrode potential above the center of the target increased by about 70 mV in both cases, and the circular symmetry of the copper sample was restored in the image.
Considering the sensitivity of the tungset/tungsten-oxide electrode, the difference between the pH of the solution adjacent to the center of the target and the bulk pH would have been underestimated by about 1.5 pH units.

\label{fig:deconvolution_tungsten}
\end{figure}

		\subsection{Experiments with ion-selective micropipettes}
Deconvolution was also applied to SECM scans performed with magnesium and potassium ion-selective micropipettes.
In these cases however, $RC$ was determined with another method.
$R$ and $C$ were measured individually.

			\subsubsection{Linescans performed with a magnesium ion-selective micropipette} 
				\paragraph{Measuring $R$ and $C$.}

First, the Mg$^{2+}$ ISME and the amplifier were characterized.
Using the voltage divider method, electrode resistance of the micropipette was measured to be 197.31 M$\ohm$.
Time constant of the cell with a 50 M$\ohm$ load inserted was 0.5577 s, therefore amplifier input capacitance (together with the capacitance of a 25 cm long coaxial cable between the electrodes and the amplifier) was 11.15 nF (0.5577 s / 50 M$\ohm$).
Time constant of the potentiometric cell with the Mg$^{2+}$ ion selective electrode could be obtained by multiplying $R$ and $C$: $\tau = R\times C$ = 2.2 s.
Sensitivity towards the primary ion was very close to nernstian, with 29.7 mV / decade.

				\paragraph{Linescans.}
Next, line scans above the center of the target were performed using three different equilibration interval lengths.
As expected, the shorter the time available for the cell for equilibration was, the more distorted the resulting scan became (Fig. \ref{fig:lines}A).
Directional line blur distortion is visible along the raw scan lines recorded with shorter equilibration intervals (1.9 s, and 0.4 s).
With $t_e$ = 4.9 s, distortion is less visible.
Based on the determined $RC$ time constant, in 4.9 seconds, 89.22\% of the total change occurs (1 - e$^{-4.9 s / 2.2 s}$ = 0.8922), and therefore the recorded signal is almost in equilibrium, and can be regarded as a reference for comparison with the concentration profiles obtained using smaller $t_e$ parameters.
With 1.9 s, and 0.4 s, only 57.87\%, and 16.62\% of the total change occurs respectively, causing a significant amount of distortion.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth, angle=-90]{img/linescans/raw_lines.eps}\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth, angle=-90]{img/linescans/deconvoluted_lines.eps}

\caption[Raw, and deconvoluted linescans conducted with the Mg$^{2+}$ ISME]{(A) Raw scan lines recorded $h$ = 100 $\upmu$m over the center of the pipette orifice, which served as a Mg$^{2+}$ ion diffusion source.
(B) Scan lines obtained after deconvolution.
$t_e$ equilibration intervals were 4.9 s (blue), 1.9 s (green), and 0.4 s (red).
Probe movement speed was 1000 $\upmu$m/s, and probe movement interval was 0.1 s.
8 scan lines were recorded in each case, 4 forward, 4 reverse scans.}
\label{fig:lines}
\end{figure}


Using Eq. \ref{eq:rc3} and the measured $RC$, the scan lines could be deconvoluted, and the E$_{\infty}$ values could be obtained (Fig. \ref{fig:lines}B).
After deconvolution, almost no change can be observed in the scan line recorded with $t_e$ = 4.9 s, which indicates that the recorded values in that scan were already in equilibrium.
By deconvoluting the other scan lines with smaller $t_e$ parameters, they became very similar to the equilibrium scan lines ($t_e$ = 4.9 s).
This indicates that the deconvolution restored the equilibrium scan line.
With $t_e$ = 0.4 s, a similar, low distortion image can be obtained as with $t_e$ = 4.9 s, but in a fraction of the time that is required for the latter.

			\subsubsection{2D scans performed with the magnesium ion-selective micropipette}

Going further, 2D raster scans were performed with the meander (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvoluted_meander}A-D) and the fast comb (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvoluted_fastcomb}A-D) algorithms.
Similarly as before, line blur distortion in the raw images is visible along the scanlines of the 2D raster.
The shorter the equilibration period was, the more visible the distortion became.
After deconvoluting the raw images, not only the circular shape of the target in the image is restored, but - based on the results of the linescan deconvolution - the maximum pMg$^{2+}$ value above the center of the target as well, using the meander (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvoluted_meander}E-H), and the fast comb scanning algorithms (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvoluted_fastcomb}E-H).
For instance, maximum pMg$^{2+}$ in the $t_e$=0.4 s meander raw scan is about 4.2, whereas in the deconvoluted image, it is about 3.6, with a significant difference between the two.
This is important where accurate quantitative information is required about the target, such as in fitting simulated scans to measured ones to calculate mass transport rate \cite{gyurcsanyi2004chemical}.\def\s{0.25}

			\subsubsection{2D scans performed with the potassium ion-selective micropipette}
2D scans employing the most widely used potassium ion-selective micropipette were also carried out.
The same cell was used as before, only the magnesium ion-selective micropipette was replaced with a potassium ion-selective micropipette.
Resistance of the potassium ion-selective micropipette was measured with the same voltage divider method, and not surprisingly, the result was very similar; $R$ = 213.42 M$\ohm$.
The time constant was $\tau = 2.38 s$.
The target was the same micropipette source, except the filling gel was replaced with a 0.2 M KCl containing 4\% agar-agar gel.
The characteristic $RC$ distortion is also visible in these images (Fig. \ref{fig:deconvolution_potassium}A-B).
After deconvolution, once again, the images resemble the radial geometry of the target.

		\subsection{Applications}
			\subsubsection{Investigation of the galvanic corrosion of zinc and copper}
During the cooperation with colleagues from the \emph{University of La Laguna}, Spain, the galvanic corrosion of zinc and copper was studied with potentiometric SECM, and the scanrate had to be high in order for the resulting image to be instantaneous. 

When zinc and copper are galvanically coupled, and are submersed in the same electrolyte, zinc will protect copper from corrosion by cathodically polarizing it.
Zinc itself becomes the anode, and $Zn^{2+}$ dissolution will take place.
Simultaneously, pH will decrease at the zinc anode, and increase at the copper cathode.
A 2D SECM scan was recorded with an antimony microelectrode, capturing both the zinc, and the copper sample (Fig. \ref{fig:zinc_copper}).
The scan was recorded at a relatively high speed ($r = 500 \upmu m/s$).
Because of the high speed, the obtained image was distorted.
An improvement in image quality in the deconvoluted image is noticable.
The processed image clearly shows the two circular targets 1000 $\upmu$m apart.
There is a significant difference between the raw and deconvoluted images, especially in the close vicinity of the targets.
Potential above the zinc anode changed from -360 mV to -300 mV as an effect of the deconvolution, which means a whole pH unit.
Potential above the copper cathode changed from -480 mV to -550 mV by deconvolution.
Both the anodic and cathodic activity would have been underestimated based on the raw, distorted image.

			\subsubsection{Investigation of the corrosion of carbon steel}
Corroding carbon steel was imaged as part of a collaboration with colleagues from the \emph{University of Ibn Zohr}, Agadir.
They were curious about the pH changes above the corroding sample while it was polarized anodically with different current densities applied.
Since corrosion is highly localized, a single linescan above the center wasn't enough, as it might not have covered all of the local anodes, ie. the surface cannot be regarded homogeneous without proof.
For this reason, the whole surface was scanned.
The total surface area was about 0.2 $cm^2$, and a relatively large image had to be taken for the whole sample to be included.
A 6000 $\upmu$m $\times$ 6000 $\upmu$m image was scanned with a step size of 100 $\upmu$m in both directions.
To make the scan as short as possible despite the large number of data aquisition points, a scanrate of 1000 $\upmu$m/s was used.
As expected, the image was distorted, and without any processing evaluation proved to be difficult.
After deconvolution, conclusions about that particular experiment could be drawn.
The irregular shape of the target (Fig. \ref{fig:carbon_steel}C) is recognisable after (Fig. \ref{fig:carbon_steel}B), but not before (Fig. \ref{fig:carbon_steel}A) the deconvolution.
The difference between the original and the processed image is quite large.
Potential difference between points of the bulk of the electrolyte and the electrolyte above the target was 140 mV and 200 mV before, and after the deconvolution, which is quite similar to values obtained in the previous experiments.
Without any processing, pH would have been misestimated by about 1 pH unit.
A different conclusion can be drawn based on the raw, and the deconvoluted image.

\subsection{Possibility of ,,blind deconvolution''}
\emph{,,Blind deconvolution''} is the technique of deconvoluting measured data without the complete knowledge of the transfer function that describes the convolution \cite{lam2000iterative}.
In the section titled ,,Minimal working example'' I deconvoluted a simple step response with several different assumed $RC$ time-constants, including the measured one.
Even with just visual inspection of the deconvoluted data, one would choose the dataset that was obtained when the correct, measured $RC$ was used in the deconvolution.
Based on this observation, blind deconvolution of 2D images might be possible.
To explore this possibility, similarly to the step response deconvolution, I deconvoluted a pH image using the deconvolution function with several different time-constant substituations, including the measured one.

A primitive version of applying this method involves the deconvolution with different $RC$ values (Fig. \ref{fig:blind}), and choosing the images with the least amount of visible $RC$ distortion.
,,Evaluating'' distortion is relatively easy if the scanning algorithm is known.
$RC$ distortion is especially visible in images scanned with the meander algorithm.
With this algorithm, subsequent scan lines in the images are shifted by twice the amount with respect to each other than with respect to a fixed point in the image, since the scan directions of subsequent lines are opposite.

The measurement was done with a potassium ion-selective electrode.
The measured time constant was $\tau = 2.38$ s.
Figure shows the raw image (A), and deconvolutions with assumed time-constants $\tau$ = 1.39 s (B), \textbf{$\tau$ = 2.38 s (C)}, $\tau$ = 7.80 s (D).}
\label{fig:blind}
\end{figure}

Observing the images, (B) is still distorted, the individual lines are ,,shifted'' in the same direction as in the raw image.
In (D) however, they are shifted in the opposite direction, because the assumed time-constant is too high, and there is excess deconvolution in the image.
(C) seems to be the best, but the lines are a bit shifted to the opposite direction.
The best result based on visual inspection would be between (B) and (C), although much closer to (C).
(C) is the image which was obtained as a result of deconvolution with the measured time-constant.

A more advanced method would be a statistical approach, where one would try to detect any correlation between the scanning algorithm -- taking into account the scan direction -- and the image, and choose the deconvoluted image with the least correlation.
